# Simple OCR Letters

Write a web service which can take an uploaded image(jpg, png) and find any letters in it. 

The result will be returned to user as JSON : 

```
{"content": [ 'Letter1', 'Letter2'...]}
``` 

This result will also be saved to database for future use. 

Requirements:

- Design your own data model and API
- Use any Python/Golang frameworks or libraries as needed
- Should include tests and documentations
- Dockerfile and docker-compose.yaml are preferred
